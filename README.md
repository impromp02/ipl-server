## IPL Dashboard
An IPL (Indian Premier League) web application developed in React and Node for data visualisation.

### List of Frameworks used
- React: It is used to develop the entire frontend application.
- react-router: Used for handling routing on the frontend.
- d3.js: For binding datasets to DOM elements on the frontend and to draw SVG shapes easily.
- Express: For building an HTTP node server on the backend.
- Mongoose: Used as a node client for mongoDB database.
- MongoDB: Used as database on the backend.

### Bonus Points

1. __Create the web-app in vue.js__: I have used Reactjs because I have been working with it for quite sometime now. Also, I haven't got my hands dirty with vue.js yet.

2. __optimize the loading time__: I have only used the packages that are required for the project to do all the heavy-lifting. Secondly, I am using code-spliting with react to make chunks for my `bundle.js` file so that the user can get quick first paint.

3. __make it mobile responsive__: I have used CSS flexbox extensively to develop the UI so that the elements adjust themselve to different screen sizes. I am also using `media-queries` when required.

4. __make it a progressive web-app__: I have not worked on this this part of the assignment due to time issues. I am aware about the concepts of PWA and I'll add it to project later.

5. __make it offline usable__: I have not worked with the ServiceWorkers and Caching yet but I am familiar about the concepts and I have discussed things like Caching strategies etc.
